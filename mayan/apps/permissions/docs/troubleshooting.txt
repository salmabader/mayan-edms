Error message: ``Unknown or obsolete permission...``
====================================================

There are two possible causes for this error message.

The first is that an upgrade did not complete successfully and previous
permission identifiers were not updated.

The second is that an upgrade did finish successfully but some permissions
were made obsolete and removed.

To fix the issue use the following management command:

For Mayan EDMS version 4.2 or earlier:

.. code-block:: console

    docker-compose run app run_command purgepermissions

For Mayan EDMS version 4.3 or later:

.. code-block:: console

    docker-compose run app run_command permissions_purge


Error message: ``Unknown or obsolete permission namespace...``
==============================================================

This error shares the same root cause as the error above and the solution
is the same too.
