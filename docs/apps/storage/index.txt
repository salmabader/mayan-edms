Storage

Mayan EDMS stores documents in their original file format only changing the
filename to avoid collision. By default, documents files are stored in the
same filesystem as the program code but by using different drivers, these
can also be placed in other storage systems like object storage.

.. important::

   Sometimes this method of controlling documents files is caraterized as
   being "destructive". However, that is not the case as the actual files
   are never destroyed or modified in anyway. This method is only used
   to avoid the operating system filesystem's inability to save two or more
   files using the same filename and to be able to assing a label to a
   document using characters that go beyond those normally supported by the
   filesystem.
